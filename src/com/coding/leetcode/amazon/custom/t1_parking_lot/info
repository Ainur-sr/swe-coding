Problem Description

There is a parking lot with a row of parking spots. Cars arrive one by one. Each driver has a preferred
spot based on their destination (e.g., closest to a specific store, elevator, exit, etc.).

Parking Rules:

* The driver first tries to park at their preferred spot.
* If that spot is already taken, the driver continues driving forward to find the next available spot.
* Drivers cannot reverse.
* If no spot is available from the preferred position to the end, the driver leaves without parking.

Given the preferences of all arriving cars, determine whether everyone can successfully park.

Clarifying Questions to Consider

* How should the input be represented?
* How are parking spots 0-indexed or 1-indexed
* What should the function return?
* What are the constraints on the number of cars and spots?
* Come up with examples to better illustrate this problem.
